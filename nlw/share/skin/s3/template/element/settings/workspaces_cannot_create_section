      In order to create a workspace, the Workspace must belong to a Group.
      You can create a new Group, or add a workspace to an existing Group.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a workspace to an existing group, go to the
      <a href="/st/groups">"Group Directory"</a>
      under the Groups pulldown in the main navigation above, go to your
      chosen group, click "Edit" and create the workspace. Currently, you can
      create a new workspace only for a private group.
    </p>
    <p>
      To add a workspace to a new group, go to
      <a href="#" onclick="showCreateGroupLightbox(); return false">"Create Group"</a>
      under the Groups pulldown in the main navigation above. From there, use
      the "Workspaces" section to create your workspace.
