This directory should contain the UTF-8 Juman Dictionary for MeCab.
Unfortuantely this dictionary is architecture dependent, and somewhat large.
So we can't include it with Socialtext itself.  Usually MeCab ships with a
EUC-JP encoded Juman Dictionary.  Socialtext tries to convert the EUC-JP
dictonary at install time, but if it fails it will warn that you should read
this file so you can do the conversion by hand.

You can convert the EUC-JP dictoary to a UTF-8 one as follows:

# NOTE: Actual paths may differ based on how MeCab was installed

# The dictinary source directory from your distribution.
DICSRC=/usr/share/mecab/dic/juman

# The output dictionary to place UTF-8 Juman Dictionary.
DICDIR=/path/to/usr/share/nlw/mecab

# Copy the existing dictionary
cp /var/lib/mecab/dic/juman/* $DICDIR

cd $DICDIR
rm *.bin *.dic dicsrc
mkdir dicsrc
ln -s $DICSRC/* dicsrc/.

# Allow Katakana words to be split out from unknown sequences
rm -f dicsrc/char.def
sed -e '/^KATAKANA/s/.*/KATAKANA	0 1 2/' \
	<$DICSRC/char.def >dicsrc/char.def

# Build the dictionary in $DICDIR, using the modified dictionary
# source in dicsrc/; the input dictionary is encoded in euc-jp
# but the resulting dictionary should be in utf-8.
/usr/lib/mecab/mecab-dict-index -d dicsrc -o . -f euc-jp -t utf-8
