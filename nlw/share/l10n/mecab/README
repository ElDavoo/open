This directory should contain the UTF-8 Juman Dictionary for MeCab.
Unfortuantely this dictionary is architecture dependent, and somewhat large.
So we can't include it with Socialtext itself.  Usually MeCab ships with a
EUC-JP encoded Juman Dictionary.  Socialtext tries to convert the EUC-JP
dictonary at install time, but if it fails it will warn that you should read
this file so you can do the conversion by hand.

You can convert the EUC-JP dictoary to a UTF-8 one as follows: 

# NOTE: Actual paths may differ based on how MeCab was installed

cp /var/lib/mecab/dic/juman/* /path/to/usr/share/nlw/mecab/
cd /path/to/usr/share/nlw/mecab/
rm *.bin *.dic
/usr/lib/mecab/mecab-dict-index -d /usr/share/mecab/dic/juman -o . -f euc-jp -t utf-8
