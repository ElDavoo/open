This directory should contain the UTF-8 Juman Dictionary for MeCab.
Unfortuantely this dictionary is architecture dependent, and somewhat large.
So we can't include it with Socialtext itself.  Usually MeCab ships with a
EUC-JP encoded Juman Dictionary.  Socialtext tries to convert the EUC-JP
dictonary at install time, but if it fails it will warn that you should read
this file so you can do the conversion by hand.

Inclusion of customized entries to the dictionary can also be
done by placing "user.csv" file (encoded in EUC-JP) in
$DICDIR/dicsrc, before building Socialtext, or performing the
conversion procedure described below.

You can convert the EUC-JP dictoary to a UTF-8 one as follows:

# NOTE: Actual paths may differ based on how MeCab was installed

# The dictinary source directory from your distribution.
DICSRC=/usr/share/mecab/dic/juman

# The output dictionary to place UTF-8 Juman Dictionary.
DICDIR=/path/to/usr/share/nlw/mecab
cd $DICDIR
mkdir dicsrc


# Convert them to UTF-8
for i in $DICSRC/*
do
 file=$(basename $i)
 iconv -c -f euc-jp -t utf-8 <"$i" >dicsrc/"$file"
done

# Allow Katakana words to be split out from unknown sequences
mv dicsrc/char.def dicsrc/char.def+
sed -e '/^KATAKANA/s/.*/KATAKANA	0 1 2/' \
	<dicsrc/char.def+ >dicsrc/char.def
rm -f dicsrc/char.def+

# The dictionary sources are utf-8 now
mv dicsrc/dicrc dicsrc/dicrc+
sed -e 's/^\(dictionary-charset =\).*/\1 utf-8/' \
	<dicsrc/dicrc+ >dicsrc/dicrc
rm -f dicsrc/dicrc+

# Link control tables from the source area.
for i in dicrc left-id.def right-id.def rewrite.def
do
  rm -f "$i"
  ln -s dicsrc/"$i" "$i"
done

# If you have customized entries to add to the dictionary,
# create dicsrc/user.csv file at this point, encoded in utf-8.
# See http://mecab.sourceforge.net/dic.html for details.


# Build the dictionary in $DICDIR, using the modified dictionary
# source in dicsrc/; the input dictionary is already encoded in
# utf-8 and the resulting dictionary should be in utf-8.
/usr/lib/mecab/mecab-dict-index -d dicsrc -o . -f utf-8 -t utf-8
