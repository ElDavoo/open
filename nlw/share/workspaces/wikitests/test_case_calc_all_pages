create a user that lexically precedes the logged in user by creating a user that begins with start_time
However, don't use %%email%% in that username because that permanently creates another user name in the user DB that
contains %%email%% as a substring and that messes up other tests like Test Case: Email

| set | s_user | %%start_time%%@%%start_time%%.socialtext.net |

| st-admin | create-user --email %%s_user%% --password 123456 |  |
| st-admin | add-member --email %%s_user%% --workspace %%workspace%% |  |
| st-logout |  |  |
| st-login | %%s_user%% | 123456 |

For some reason, IE 6 blows up when open_ok is used in some places. We avoid it.
