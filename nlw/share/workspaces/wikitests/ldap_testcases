These testcases work for an LDAP user but not for a default user.
These testcases REQUIRE that LDAP be enabled.
Any LDAP user specific testcases should go here.

Every test should override the passed in values as follows:

| set | username | devnull3 |
| set | email | devnull3@socialtext.com |
| set | password | Ko013344 |
| set | email_esc | devnull3\@socialtext.com |

* [Enable LDAP]

These are variations on Default user testcases.
They must explicitly use the above ldap username, email, and pwd so LDAP Testcases can be called
from tests where a Default user is logged in.

* [Test Case: Verify LDAP Enabled]
* [Test case: LDAP Login Logout]
* [Test case: LDAP User Resets Password]
* [Test case: LDAP Admin Resets Password]
* [Test Case: LDAP Dashboard]
* [Test Case: LDAP Public]
* [Test Case: LDAP Workspace Configuration]
* [Test Case: LDAP Workspace Privacy]

Special test case for LDAP user using CLI

* [Test Case: Command Line: LDAP USERS]

Special test for LDAP user deletion.

TODO: this testcases is broken until the OpenLDAP local server is implemented

`* [Test Case: LDAP Deleted User]`
