These testcases work for an LDAP user but not for a default user.
These testcases REQUIRE that LDAP be enabled.
Any LDAP user specific testcases should go here.

Every test should override the passed in values as follows:

 set | username | devnull3 |
set | email | devnull3@socialtext.com |
set | password | ldapd3v |
set | email_esc | devnull3\@socialtext.com |

LDAP test cases must explicitly use the above ldap username, email, and pwd so LDAP Testcases can be called from tests where a Default user is logged in.

* [Test Case: A Enable LDAP]

Test Case: Verify LDAP Enabled verifies the LDAP user screens for Login/Logout, Password Reset, Admin resets password, and self register

* [Test Case: Verify LDAP Enabled]

Special test case for LDAP user CLI commands

* [Test Case: Command Line: LDAP USERS]

Run a fairly complex testcase logged in as the LDAP user

* [Test Case: LDAP Watchlist]

Make sure that the "Email this page" popup works correctly with LDAP users

* [Test Case: Email page shows LDAP emails]

Special test for LDAP user deletion.

* [Test Case: LDAP Deleted User]

* [Test Case: A Enable LDAP]
