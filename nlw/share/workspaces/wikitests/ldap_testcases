These testcases work for an LDAP user but not for a default user.
These testcases REQUIRE that LDAP be enabled.
Any LDAP user specific testcases should go here.

Every test should override the passed in values as follows:

 set | username | devnull3 |
 set | email | devnull3@socialtext.com |
 set | password | ldapd3v |
 set | email_esc | devnull3\@socialtext.com |

* [Test Case: A Enable LDAP]

These are variations on Default user testcases.
They must explicitly use the above ldap username, email, and pwd so LDAP Testcases can be called
from tests where a Default user is logged in.

* [Test Case: Verify LDAP Enabled]

Test Case: Verify LDAP Enabled is a substitute for these testcases:

`[Test case: LDAP Login Logout]`
`[Test case: LDAP User Resets Password]`
`[Test case: LDAP Admin Resets Password]`

Special test case for LDAP user using CLI

* [Test Case: Command Line: LDAP USERS]

Special test for LDAP user deletion.

TODO: this testcases is broken until the OpenLDAP local server is implemented

`* [Test Case: LDAP Deleted User]`
