Firefox is our primary testing browser. As many testcases as possible are run here.

We run with LDAP enabled for a more robust test

* [Enable LDAP]

* [Core Testcases]
* [File Testcases]
* [LDAP Testcases]
* [Localization Testcases]
* [Test case: Business Control Panel]
* [Test case: Control Panel Reports]

Then we turn off LDAP and run the Default user testcases

* [Disable LDAP]
* [Default User Testcases]

^ All pages tagged 'Testcase' (only a list, visit the pages above for tests)

Tests do not run out of the list since it isn't really here.
