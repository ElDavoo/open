| *Comment* | Test Case: Miki Authentication |  |

If this test fails, and it fails in IE 6 because IE 6 caches Miki pages even when it should not,
it leaves the workspace in auth-to-edit mode because it does not run teardown and that breaks all tests
that follow it. So we do this test in a scratch workspace instead

test latest login scheme:

* Look at your dev-env at /lite/page/auth-to-edit
* Click on the Log In link, make sure you get redirected appropriately back to central page
* Check that the links now say "Log Out" (at the bottom) and "Edit" at the top
* Log out and in a few times to make sure everything behaves right
