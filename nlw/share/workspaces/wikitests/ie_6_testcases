*IE 6 is required*
*File testcases don't work in IE because iehta permissions not implemented in Selenium*
*Socialcalc enabled is required because we run Calc Testcases*

*It is possible to run as the default LDAP user*
*if you first run `xwt enable_ldap` to get LDAP enabled so the default LDAP user may successfully login.*

* [Test Case: A Enable LDAP]

* [Test case: IE Miki Authentication]

* [Core Testcases]
* [Calc Testcases]
* [Test case: Business Control Panel]
* [Report Testcases]

LDAP Testcases will Enable LDAP and use a known LDAP user instead of a Default user where required

* [LDAP Testcases]

Default User Testcases will Disable LDAP so it can test wiki functions that only work for the Default user
It should be the last testset in this run, but it will re-enable LDAP when it finishes.

* [Default User Testcases]

IE 6 uses the RSS Icons low Permissions test case

But it seems no combination of servers and settings lets the RSS test run now. I think it used to run ??

`IE6 Test Case: RSS Icons LowPermissions`

*Localization testcases cause IE 6 to segfault*
