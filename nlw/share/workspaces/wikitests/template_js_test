The next pause seems to be necessary for the test to run reliably.
Why doesn't the `wait_for ..` take care of the needed interlock?

| pause | 5000 |  |
| wait_for_text_present_ok | .. | 20000 |

Then simply wait for the "maximum" execution time (estimate for now)

| pause | __EXECUTIONTIME__ |  |

Then check the outcome.

| wait_for_text_not_present_ok | Error | 2000 |
| wait_for_text_not_present_ok | not ok | 2000 |
