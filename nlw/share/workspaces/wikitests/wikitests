This is not a test page, but it is tagged testcase so that it appears in the wiki after wikitests-from-wiki is run.

This is the central page for the wikitests wiki. Each code branch has its own tests checked in to the branch at nlw/share/workspaces/wikitests/, along with a standard exported tarball of wikitests.1.tar.gz which is used to instantiate wikitests on an appliance VE. These are the commands used to manipulate wikitests in a dev env:

^^^ Wikitest Commands

| Command | Effect |
| wikitests-to-wiki | build a /wikitests wiki from the files in the branch |
| wikitests-from-wiki | update the files in the branch from the /wikitests wiki |
| tests-to-tarballs | create wikitests.1.tar.gz from the /wikitests wiki |

wikitests-from-wiki and tests-to-tarballs create new versions of files that have to be commited using svn.

^^^ Working with wikitest files in a dev env

Working with wikitest files in a dev env is a bit tricky. In addition to observing the development practices for shared code development as outlined below, there are additional steps required to move files to and from the /wikitests wiki. *If you don't do these steps correctly, you risk overwriting new versions of tests with old versions stored in your /wikitests wiki*.

^^^^ Wikitests working session protocol

* cdwt (cd to nlw/share/workspaces/wikitests)
* `wikitests-from-wiki` to dump any work that you have already performed in the wiki to the FS.
* `svn up` to get all new versions of files and, in particular, to reveal conflicts between your work and checked in work.
** resolve conflicts. This is important. `svn up` and repeat until there are no new files brought up.
** `svn commit` your resolved conflicts.
* `wikitests-to-wiki` to put all the latest files into /wikitests
* modify files in /wikitests during your working session.
* `wikitests-from-wiki` to copy files from /wikitests to your working copy
* `svn up` AGAIN to fetch any work that might have occurred while you were in your working session.
** resolve conflicts. This is important. `svn up` and repeat until there are no new files brought up.
* `svn commit` your new work and any resolved conflicts
* if the `svn up` brought in new work by others, repeat `wikitests-to-wiki` to move it into /wikitests
* run `tests-to-tarballs` and `svn commit` the new tarball
