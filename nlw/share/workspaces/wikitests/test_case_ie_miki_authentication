| *Comment* | Test Case: IE Miki Authentication |  |

If this test fails it leaves the workspace in auth-to-edit mode because it does not run teardown and that breaks all tests
that follow it. So we do this test in a scratch workspace instead.

This version of the Miki Authentication test is deliberately jiggered to defeat IE 6 caching. It is not as strong a test as 
the original but it is better than failing completely because IE 6 caches Miki pages.

Because IE 6 caches the Miki page, if you try to open the homepage again, even though you are logged out
you will appear to succeed. The workaround is to open a non-existent page instead

test latest login scheme:

* Look at your dev-env at /lite/page/auth-to-edit
* Pick a link on that page (start here?)
* Click on the Log In link, make sure you get redirected appropriately back to 'Start Here'
* Check that the links now say "Log Out" (at the bottom) and "Edit" at the top
* Log out and in a few times to make sure everything behaves right
