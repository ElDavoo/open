| *Comment* | Test Case: Inter Workspace Search |  |

| *Comment* | This test relies on the presence of test-data and deliberately overwrites fixed workspace names so subsequent runs will work with `workspaces:*` |  |
| *Comment* | When re-ordering workspace names alphabetically 'pause' is required in this case because there is no new text to look for with wait_for_text_present_ok. Attempting wait_for_text_present_ok with the qr// value from st-result doesn't work. |  |

| st-admin | set-workspace-config --workspace test-data2 title test-data2 | The workspace config for test-data2 has been updated. |
| st-admin | clone-workspace --workspace test-data --target test-data3 --overwrite | The test-data workspace has been cloned to test-data3 |
| st-admin | set-workspace-config --workspace test-data3 title test-data3 | The workspace config for test-data3 has been updated. |
