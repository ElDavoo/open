Saving profile changes causes selenium top-level to disappear. Until we get that fixed, we split testing into two pieces that will run in two different instantiations of a Selenium browser. The first one modifies the profile, the second one verifies the modifications. They have to be run as a pair because they rely on the value of `%%start_time%%` being the same in both tests.

You can develop Verify Profile without always having to run Edit Profile by redefining the value of `%%start_time%%` at the top of Verify Profile to be whatever it was when you last ran Edit Profile.
