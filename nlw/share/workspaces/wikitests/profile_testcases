Saving profile changes causes selenium top-level to disappear. Until we get that fixed, we split testing into two pieces that will run in two different instantiations of a Selenium browser. The first one modifies the profile, the second one verifies the modifications. They have to be run as a pair - Edit Profile fills in the profile and is forced to exit immediately after saving the profile, and Verify Profile checks it.

I tried to hook these tests together using %%start_time%% and other tricks to pass a username between them, but failed. So the username is always `profile.editor@ken.socialtext.net`

fill in the users profile

* [Test Case: Edit Profile]

verify the filled in profile

* [Test Case: Verify Profile]

verify the profile avatar popup

* [Test Case: Verify Avatar Popup]

test profile (People) tagging

* [Test Case: Tagging Profile]

test Collegues widget in other user's profile

* [Test Case: Profile Group List]

There is a further glitch in that wait_for_element_... does not seem to work for widgets. If the profile does not open immediately, the test just runs on. This may need a frame select - Matt to investigate.
