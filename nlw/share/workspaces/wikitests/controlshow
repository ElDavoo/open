This is the slideshow for the control and console UIs
It is strictly for clicking and viewing, not functional testing.

This test case is an aid to visually observing each screen type in the application. The test case cycles through screens, printing out SEE instructions to the test person. The test person should observe the browser under test at each SEE point along the way. The test person may pause at any point to examine the screen visually using CTRL-Z to suspend the testing process and the unix command `fg` to resume it.
