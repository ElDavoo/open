*As many Appliance testcases as possible are run here*.
Firefox is required because we run File Testcases
Socialcalc enabled is required because we run Calc Testcases

*It is possible to run Firefox testcases as the default LDAP user*
*if you first run `xwt enable_ldap` to get LDAP enabled so the default LDAP user may successfully login.*

* [Core Testcases]
* [Test Case: Miki Authentication]

LDAP Testcases will Enable LDAP and use a known LDAP user instead of a Default user where required

* [LDAP Testcases]

Default User Testcases will Disable LDAP so it can test wiki functions that only work for the Default user
It should be the last testset in this run, but it will re-enable LDAP when it finishes.

*Note that we do not run Report Testcases as they require a special test setup in a dev env*
