Firefox is our primary testing browser. As many testcases as possible are run here.
In addition, the Appliance specific test cases are run.

We run with LDAP enabled for a more robust test

* [Enable LDAP]

* [Core Testcases]
* [File Testcases]
* [LDAP Testcases]
* [Localization Testcases]
* [Test case: Business Control Panel]
* [Test case: Control Panel Reports]

Then we turn off LDAP and run the Default user testcases

* [Disable LDAP]

* [Default User Testcases]

These testcases are specific to the appliance.

* [Test case: Appliance Console]
* [Test case: Console Backup and Restore]
