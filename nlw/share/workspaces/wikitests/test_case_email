TODO: Get Selenium to select more than one user simultaneously

TODO: Figure out why verifyChecked doesn't work. Note that there may be a bug in the form that is causing verifyChecked
to not work: type an email into the additional recipients box and uncheck the box. The additional recipient is added to
the recipient list as if the Add Additional User button had been pushed. Do the button and the checkbox have the same ID or name?
