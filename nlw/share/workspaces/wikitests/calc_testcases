^ TODOs and Consider-s

 `[Test Case New Page No Overwrite]` (Features to do this now are missing from socialcalc)
 `[Test Case: stemming]` DO WE WANT TO ADD STEMMING TESTS TO SOCIALCALC PAGES ?
 `[Test Case: Sidebar: Incoming Links]` (Features to do this now are missing from socialcalc)
 `[Test Case: Revisions]` (Features to do this now are missing from socialcalc)
 `[Test Case: Home]` (This behavior relies on the old home page and is dependent on dashboard. Calctests should not do that.)
 `[Test Case: Inter Workspace Search]` - TBD.
