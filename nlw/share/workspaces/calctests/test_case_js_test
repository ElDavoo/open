| *Comment* | Test Case: JS Test: load the js-test package |  |
| open | /static/%%start_time%%/js-test/run |  |

Note: because of the way the js-test works, selenium does not "see" the intermediate results.
But it does "see" the final printout.

| wait_for_text_present_ok | All tests successful | 260000 |
