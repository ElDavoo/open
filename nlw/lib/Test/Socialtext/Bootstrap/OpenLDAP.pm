=head1 NAME

Test::Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP - Test::Builder helper for Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # auto-detect OpenLDAP, skipping all tests if it can't be found.
  use Test::Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP;
  use Test::Socialtext tests => ...

  # bootstrap OpenLDAP, add some data, and start testing
  ...

or, if you want to fail outright if OpenLDAP can't be found...

  # auto-detect OpenLDAP, failing the test and aborting if it
  # can't be found.
  use Test::Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP qw(:fatal);
  use Test::Socialtext tests => ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Test::Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP> implements a C<Test::Builder> helper
for C<Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP>.  On load, we try to auto-detect the
installed copy of OpenLDAP and then skip/fail tests as appropriate.

By default, C<Test::Socialtext::Bootstrap::OpenLDAP> does a "skip_all" if
we're unable to find OpenLDAP.  By using the C<:fatal> tag on import, though,
you can turn this into an assertion which causes the tests to fail outright.

B<NOTE:> this does mean, though, that you have to C<use> this bootstrap
I<before> you set up your test plan!
