=head1 NAME

Socialtext::l10n - Provides localization functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Socialtext::l10n qw(loc loc_lang);

    my $deferred = _('wiki.welcome');    # deferred loc()
    loc_lang('fr');                      # set the locale
    is loc('wiki.welcome'), 'Bienvenue'; # find localized text
    is $deferred, 'Bienvenue';           # this also works

=head1 Methods

=head2 loc("example.string", $arg)

loc() will lookup the english string to find the localized string.  If
no localized string can be found, the english string will be used.

See Locale::Maketext::Simple for information on string formats.

=head2 _("example.string", $arg)

Creates a I<deferred> string. It's evaluated in the active locale whenever
its value is used.

There is no need to import C<_> explicitly; it's a global function.

=cut

=head2 loc_lang

Set the locale.

=head2 best_locale( [$hub] )

This function tries to find the "best" locale in the current context.  If a
hub is passed in then we try to find the current user's locale in the current
workspace.  We can't find that (or a hub isn't passed in) then we instead
return the system locale.

=head2 system_locale( )

Returns the current system wide locale code.

=head1 Localization Files

The .po files are kept in share/l10n.
