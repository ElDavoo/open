=head1 NAME

Socialtext::Authz - API for permissions checks

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Socialtext::Authz;

  my $authz = Socialtext::Authz->new;
  $authz->user_has_permission_for_workspace(
      user       => $user,
      permission => $permission,
      workspace  => $workspace,
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides an API for checking if a user has a specific
permission in a workspace. While this can be checked by using the
C<Socialtext::Workspace> class's API, the goal of this layer is to
provide an abstraction that can be used to implement authorization
outside of the DBMS, for example by using LDAP.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 Socialtext::Authz->new()

Returns a new C<Socialtext::Authz> object.

=head2 $authz->user_has_permission_for_workspace(PARAMS)

Returns a boolean indicating whether the user has the specified
permission for the given workspace.

Requires the following PARAMS:

=over 8

=item * user - a user object

=item * permission - a permission object

=item * workspace - a workspace object

=back

=head2 $authz->user_is_business_admin( user => $user )

=head2 $authz->user_is_technical_admin( user => $user )

Returns a boolean indicating whether the user has the named
system-wide privilege.

=head2 $authz->plugin_enabled_for_user(PARAMS)

Returns a boolean indicating whether the user has the ability to use a plugin through one of his/her account memberships.

When checking if two users can both use a plugin, see C<< $authz->plugin_enabled_for_users(PARAMS) >>.

Requires the following PARAMS:

=over 8

=item * user - a user object

=item * plugin_name - the name of the plugin to check

=back

=head2 $authz->plugin_enabled_for_users(PARAMS)

Returns a boolean indicating if a plugin can be used for some interaction between two users.  Currently, this is implemented as a check to see if both users share any accounts where the plugin is enabled.  In the future, this may be expanded out to use an access-control mechanism that may or may not use user-specified access assertions.

Requires the following PARAMS:

=over 8

=item * actor - a user object, the "subject" in an interaction.

=item * user - another user object, the "object" in an interaction.

=item * plugin_name - the name of the plugin to check

=back

Typical usage might be that actor is the current logged-in user where the actor wishes to interact with a user the context of a plugin.  To use Socialtext People as an example, actor wishes to view a user's profile: this method would return true if actor is allowed to interact with that user's profile.

=head2 $authz->plugin_enabled_for_user_in_account(PARAMS)

Returns a boolean indicating whether a user is permitted to use a plugin within the context of an account.  To use Socialtext People as an example, say the user wants to view a directory listing for an account: this method would return true if the user was able to view listings for this account.

Requires the following PARAMS:

=over 8

=item * user - a user object

=item * account - a C<Socialtext::Account> object

=item * plugin_name - the name of the plugin to check

=back
