* Create a group using the default account & user
* Make sure that user count is 0: SystemUser shouldn't added as an admin

| set      | g1                         | g1-%%start_time%%                                              |
| st-admin | create-group --name %%g1%% | %%g1%% Group has been created (Group Id:                       |
| st-admin | list-groups                | qr/%%g1%% .\s+0 .\s+0 .\s+[\w\.]+ . [\d-]+ .\s+system-user/ |

* Can't create a group with a duplicate name

| st-admin | create-group --name %%g1%% | The %%g1%% Group has already been added to the system. |

* Create with a specific account

| set | g2 | g2-%%start_time%% |
| st-admin | create-group --name %%g2%% --account %%account%% | %%g2%% Group has been created (Group Id:                        |
| st-admin | list-groups                                      | qr/%%g2%% .\s+0 .\s+0 .\s+%%account%% . [\d-]+ .\s+system-user/ |

* Create with a specific user
# This time, the user count is 1 because %%username%% is not system created, and thus should be added as an admin to the group

| set | g3 | g3-%%start_time%% |
| st-admin | create-group --name %%g3%% --email %%username%% | %%g3%% Group has been created (Group Id:                     |
