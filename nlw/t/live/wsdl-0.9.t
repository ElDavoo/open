This test needs to check that we get back a real 200 OK from the server.
RT ticket #23921 found that no content-type or 200 OK was getting sent
back when requesting the WSDL file.  Since we always test through a proxy,
this is a non-issue, because the proxy just supplies its own 200.

To test this, you'll have to check the $response->{_msg} field directly,
and not just check $response->code, because we already know it comes
back as 200.  What we want is to check that the _msg is "200 OK" not
"200 Assumed OK".

To update this test properly, we need to update the infrastructure to
allow the test to query Socialtext::Build as to what ports the various
Apaches are running on: APP_HTTP_PORT, APP_HTTPS_PORT, PROXY_HTTP_PORT
and PROXY_HTTPS_PORT, most likely.  Then, this test can query directly
on the APP_HTTP_PORT and be sure of bypassing the proxy.
