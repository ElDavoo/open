  Refactored ceqlotron to allow for an alternate event listener that combines the current four change events into a single process call to st-admin instead of forking individual processes.

  fetchrss-relative-links - Fix links without a hostname found in RSS feeds using the {fetchrss} wafl.

Release notes, 2.18.3.0  Jan 2008

Happy New Year

  [BUGS]

   {rt: 27013} - When creating a new weblog from the settings page it is possible to create blogs with names like "foo Blog Weblog" when "foo Blog" should be accepted. This branch includes a fix to that problem, as well as more complete testing of blog creation.

   Spike Bug 151: previous code sampled only 1000 chars of a file to guess attachment type. This wasn't sufficient for all filetypes

   Spike bug 154: Properly localize the link to the japanese help docs from the workspace permissions page.

   Bug fix for a login problem after a failover, failback.  There was a problem when the MAC used for verifying the authenticity of the user cookie.  There was also a problem if the user_id (PK) changed in the DBMS.

   {bz: 398} Syncing in Socialtext Unplugged when using Internet Explorer has not been working, apparently for quite some time. The branch upgrades our unplugged template to the latest version of Tiddlywiki, incorporating a bug fix for the IE problem.

   [FEATURES]

   Work was done to improve the Socialtext Control Panel.

Release notes, 2.18.2.0  Dec 2007

  [BUGS]

  A major refactoring was done to the html-to-wikitext converter in the Wikiwyg component.  A large number of bugs were shaken out and fixed during this refactoring.

  {bz: 367} This fix updates inheritance of skin properties to allow newly created workspaces with custom skins to work properly.

  {bz: 359} The CSS Kit will now properly configure a workspace when it is uploaded using the CSS Uploader tool.

  The email this page popup was loading combined-source.js multiple times.

  {bz: 325} Prevents renaming a page to the name "Untitled Page".

  The Alzabno refactoring that came in with 2.17.3.0 in combination with work to deal with deleted ldap users introduced a useless SQL UPDATE statement being issued at least once per request, likely more often.  These extra updates are now guarded against.

Release notes, 2.18.1.0  Dec 2007

  [BUGS]

  {bz: 342} Fixes a bug where a workspace with deleted ldap users could not be backed up and restored.

  {rt: 27334} Bad parameters passed to RTF export would cause an app error.

  Removed file name globbing when building CSS links when displaying pages.  We are now stricter about what CSS files get included.

  {bz: 127} Fixed bug where clicking on an included page called "Foo Bar" brings you to an edit form where the title is set to "Foo Bar" rather than "foo_bar". Also, included pages which do not exist are now styled the same as other page links to non-existing pages.

  fix-500-page: When we started generating the 500 pages using genconfig, they started getting a bunch of gunk on the top of the page. This release fixes genconfig to not stick that header there.

  Remove dependency on external modules from the configure script due to localization.

  {bz: 335} When we generate a list of attachments to fulfill the attachments_listall view, properly defer to workspace settings to determine if we should obscure email addresses.

  {bz: 331} The login, forgot password and register screens would all display a hard coded mailto link to
root@talc.socialtext.net. This was bogus and an artifact of a previous refactoring.
Now the already configured support_address email address is being used.

  {rt: 26987} Modified HitCounterPlugin.pm to validate page_id input and avoid template errors (due to render_screen not having a template set).  This was generating app errors.


  
Release notes, 2.18.0.0  Dec 2007

  [FEATURES]

  st-admin scrub-user --username test2@example.com.
  This removes test2@example.com from all the workspaces they belong too. It also removes the business admin and technical admim privileges, if they have them.

  Feed Improvements - Add the page creator, page tags, and page attachments to the outgoing Atom and RSS feeds.

  
  [BUGS]
  
  A number of i18n and l10n localization fixes and related bug fixes.

  {bz: 323} Nested tables have a tiny font size -- no more! Where nexted tables really means included tables.

  {bz: 348}  The My Workspaces list was being built from a SQL query that due to bad
logical operator grouping was listing duplicates AND all workspaces for which the
current user had READ permission.

2.17.X

Release notes, 2.17.3.0  Nov 2007

  [FEATURES]

  Socialtext has been using an Object Relational Mapping tool called Alz-abo since about version 1.9.  This tool has proven to be somewhat slow and sometimes hard to work with.  Rather than stick with the tool and try and fix it, we've decided to transition ourselves away from it and away from a general purpose ORM altogether.  
  This release introduces a new class, Socialtext::SQL and removes the Alz-abo dependency from these classes:
* Socialtext::Account
* Socialtext::Permission
* Socialtext::Role
* Socialtext::UserId
* Socialtext::UserMetadata
* Socialtext::User::Default
* Socialtext::Watchlist
* Socialtext::WorkspaceBreadcrumb

  Socialtext also provides some tools to manage deployment of custom skins from our customer skins repository.  There was some restructuring to the repository and the tools have changed to support that.

Release notes, 2.17.2.0  Nov 2007

  [BUGS]

  {rt: 27572} Pluggable auth is not robust against user records moving in the back-end store  This branch closes an edge case where user records are moved in a user store, resulting in a failure to locate them based on a known, previously valid identifier. 

  {rt: 27292} Backups - When using a Directory Server for the User store, adding and deleting users could cause subsequent backups and restores to fail.

  {rt: 27049} formatter: toc does not appear on initial preview

  {rt: 25472} Dashboard: "Your workspaces" displays workspace that user is no longer member of.

  {rt: 26314} Logo: Can't upload a logo at all.  Uploading logo images using an Internet Explorer browser broke some time ago, this fixes it.  Problem had to do with the way IE presented the file name in the POST content.

  {rt: 27506} htmldoc creates many temp files in /var/tmp that don't get cleaned up

  {bug: 310} app error from search RSS.  If a search RSS result set contained pages with UTF-8 page titles, the request would generate an application error.

  [REFACTORING]

  This change adjusts scalar $page->all_revision_ids() to $page->revision_count(). This allows us to later change the implementation of counting how many revisions a page has, as well as limiting the number of direct calls to all_revision_ids (which is primarily used in the code in the scalar context).

Release notes, 2.17.1.0  Nov 2007

  [BUGS]

  {rt: 26851}: Tags with zero pages are not getting removed.

  {rt: 26179}: safari: "Replace this text with your own" does not go away when clicked.

  {rt: 27013}: creating a blog name ending in "Blog" gives "Blog Weblog"

  {rt: 25757}: Widgets: no scrollbars in Preview mode in IE after editing a widget

  {rt: 27006}: Subjects get stripped of Re: but not Fw: on mailed in pages

  {rt: 19983}: Send page by email: munging wikitext

  {bz: 321}:   Footer is not big enough.  2.17.0 introduced a new footer design, but it didn't scale well on really wide browser windows.  There 

  [FEATURES]

  Adding basic auth to Ajax.js so js-test doesn't need to login.

  We were still publishing URLs for feeds in public workspaces with a /noauth prefix. This is no longer necessary. Code has been changed appropriately.

Release notes, 2.17.0.0  Oct 2007

  [FEATURES]

  Workspace Settings Custom Skin:
        Socialtext enables you to customize the look and feel of your
        workspace. You can use the default skin supplied by Socialtext or
        customize your own skin.  To customize your own skin, download the
        Skin Customization Kit, modify the skin files to your liking, and
        upload them here. Complete documentation on skin customization is
        available in the Socialtext Style Customization Guide.

  Workspace Template
        Provides a workspace setting, workspace_template, which makes
        possible multiple user interface templates running side-by-side on the
        same Socialtext installation. This makes it possible to do agile,
        iterative design and development without harming existing
        customers. This is especially friendly to internal development and
        custom skin clients. We can make fast progress without stepping on
        others' toes.

  Visible Miki
        Link to miki is in the top bar
        Visible Miki DYK

  New Footer
  
  Added a common.css, that is used despite alternate skins

  Make all query wafls look like toc.

  [BUGS]

  {rt: 27491}: Prod (2.16.0.1): untitled_page makes for messes.  There were problems with untitled_pages.

  {rt: 26174}: IE7: lightbox in FF missing. Problems with the Save Page As lightbox in FF and IE7.

  {rt: 26191}: Login: FF and IE7 different behavior logging into "public authenticate to edit" workspace

  {rt: 27596}: IE 7.0 still putting in white spaces in simple edit mode.  More fixes for dealing with extra vertical whitespace.

2.16.X

Release notes, 2.16.1.0  Oct 2007

  [FEATURES]

  combined-source.js is now served as a gzip compressed file to browsers.  Except for browsers like Safari that don't support this.  This speeds up initial page loads on browsers that don't have a cached version of the file.

  {rt: 23228}: Admin: make these st-admin commands.  We've added a number of tools to the st-admin command line interface.  purge-attachment, confirm-user, show-members, show-admins, show-impersonators, set-user-names, invite-user.

  [BUGS]

  {rt: 26769}: Can we fix loc() to quote brackets.  Localized message ids can now contain brackets.

  {rt: 26637}: st-admin clone-workspace capitalization problem.  When cloning a workspace, if you used a mixed case workspace-name for the target workspace, the name would not get normalized properly.

  {rt: 22646}: Settings: Users should not be able to create a workspace that begins with '-'.
Release notes, 2.16.0.0  Sept 2007

  {rt: 25272}: Appliance: add an empty /etc/apache2/conf.d/*.conf file to silence log rotation warnings on appliances

  [FEATURES]
  
  Inter-Wiki Search is now available.  Queries can be sent to searches
  with the form "search terms workspaces:workspace-1,workspace-2,workspace-4".  
  Note in the comma seperated list of workspaces, there can be no spaces.

  [BUGS]

  Usage report stats (st-workspace-view-edit-stats) now behaves better in LDAP authenticated
  environments. {rt: 27198}

  To support better Javascript testing in IE, some changes to the JS-Test framework were made.

2.15.X
    [BUGS]
    rt-26744 - An infinite loop could be created with the caching of breadcrumb trails.  Similar
    yet different from rt-25330.

Release notes, 2.15.1.1  Sept 2007
  [BUGS]
  
  Fixed some verticial whitespace issues in Simple/Advanced mode Wikiwyg editing. {rt: 26980, 26979, 24032}

  Fixed an issue where a link could be split two links if a user caused a BR to be entered by pressing enter at the end of the link while in Wikiwyg editing. {rt: 24622}

  Wikiwyg fixes for dynamic WAFL formatting, using the word "value" in a header, addition of whitespace around WAFL objects when switching from Preview to Simple, and adding a colon to a search term in a search_full WAFL phrase.  {rt: 1458, 24032, 26959, 26989, 26994}

  Fixed an issue with the REST method /data/workspaces/:ws/pages/:page where the page has an included page (include WAFL phrase).  When requesting the text/html representation of the page, an 'edit this page' widget would be included in the include page's html "frame".  This is undesirable and has been removed.  NO TICKET

  Fixed an issue with using square brackets "[]" in a weblog title that caused an application error.  {rt: 26696}

  Fixed an issue with the login workflow when using "miki" like URLs "/lite...". {rt: 22089}

  Improved tag searching, allowing for searches like `tag:"sheep cow"`.  Note that indexing of a page must happen in order for this behavior to be noticed.  New pages, edited pages and new workspaces will all be handled automatically.  {rt: 22654}

  Made the representation of toc WAFL blocks look better in "miki".  {rt: 26827}

Release notes, 2.15.0.0  Sept 2007

    This version introduces pluggability for authentication, allowing for
    alternate challenge systems such as OpenID (coming soon) or alternate
    credentials extraction systems.

    Additionally, this version introduces export to word and pdf.  More 
    information on this can be found on the following page:

    https://www.socialtext.net/help/index.cgi?release_notes_for_socialtext_2_11_export_to_word_and_pdf

Synced with ST-based trunk -r14912

2.5.0.2     Fri Dec 15 10:58:39 CST 2006

    [FEATURES]

    Socialtext Unplugged is a way of creating an "airplane" wiki that
    allows a user to "unplug" some segment of pages from a wiki, take
    them away offline, edit them, and resynch them back to the workspace
    when the user returns to the Internet.

    The code being released is of beta quality. It has been developed so
    it is only available to those workspaces which have been configured
    to use it.  The Socialtext Unplugged capability can be turned on in
    a workspace with the following st-admin command:

        st-admin set-workspace-config --workspace <workspace name> enable_unplugged 1

    This will cause an unplug icon to be displayed on page displays,
    recent changes lists, watchlist displays and some other page listing
    screens. When the unplug icon is clicked, a zipped archive of those
    pages will be saved to the user's computer. Inside that archive is
    a file named index.html that, when opened, is a TiddlyWiki version
    of the pages that were unplugged.

    Socialtext Unplugged currently works best with Firefox.  The results
    pages with Internet Explorer are a bit unclear, and Safari doesn't
    work at all yet.

    For more about Socialtext Unplugged, see the FAQ at
    https://www.socialtext.net/exchange/index.cgi?socialtext_unplugged_faq


    [FIXES]
    Reversed the change in 2.3.0.1 that changes how config files are included.
    Now, Apache Includes conf.d/*.conf as before.

    Undeleting a page with utf8 characters in the title caused an app error.

    Removed a stray period from the end of a line in the email template
    so that the link works if you click it in all mail clients.

    The "Duplicate page" popup now sets focus to the name field.

    Nav bar was missing when invalid action returns to homepage.

    Orphans list action now works correctly.

    Rationalized link ordering in nav bar and list view.

    Fixed incorrect instructions on My Workspaces interface page.

    Images with a query string would not get displayed.
    
    Included Socialtext::InitFunctions

    [INTERNALS]
    Socialtext::WeblogUpdates was getting loaded into Apache
    unnecessarily.

    Setting of default values of server-admin and support-address are
    now done in build/defaults.pl, instead of configure.

    The t/*.t tests have been streamlined in some cases to use fewer test
    fixtures.  All I did on this branch was review the tests and try to
    make them use fewer fixtures. For example, there were several tests
    using the "workspaces" fixture that only needed "admin" or "foobar".


2.3.1.0     Mon Nov 27 11:57:18 CST 2006

    This is an important update that fixes two big bugs in 2.3.0.1.

    [FIXES]
    File attachment uploads and page tagging didn't work because their
    handlers were missing in the Apache config.

    Fixed filename of the Excel worksheet extractor.

    The ConfigureValues.pm file was getting created at the wrong time.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    XML::SAX is now optional, not required.  This saves two CPAN
    distributions to install.


2.3.0.1     Mon Nov 20 12:57:26 CST 2006

    [FEATURES]

    Tags may now be deleted.  Tags that are not used on any page are
    automatically removed. To delete an unwanted tag, go to the list
    of tags, view all pages with that tag, and remove the tag from any
    pages that contain it.

    Improved support for HTML email. When a user sends rich email to the
    workspace, it is converted to formatted wikitext with inline images.

    Brought back the option to see "recently viewed" and "what's new"
    in sidebar boxes, temporarily removed in Socialtext 2.0.

    Extensive new searching features for file attachments.  With optional
    external programs installed, the Socialtext page indexer can also
    index the contents of many different file types, including:
        * Microsoft Word and Excel documents
        * RTF, PDF and PostScript documents
        * HTML documents
        * MP3 audio
        * generic XML documents
        * compressed zip files

    The REST API has been updated.  Primary new features include:
        * /data/workspaces/:ws/homepage redirects to the current homepage
          of the workspace
        * /data/version contains the version number of the API
        * page collections have better titles
        * collections now support order=alpha
        * attachments are sortable by name (alpha) and size
        * utf8 path names are allowed
        * JSON representation is available for PUTting pages (helps with
          wiki imports)
        * when retrieving a JSON representation of a workspace, admins get
          a bunch of good info, non-admins get a small amount of information
          (still useful)
        * Dynamically generated WSDL file, instead of a statically
          served file.

    The list view that shows pages with a specific tag now enables
    column sorting.

    Reduced the size of headings.  Headings (H1-H6) are, in general, too
    large. As a result users often resort to starting with H2 or H3. That
    breaks any chance of meaningful hierarchical data in wikitext. Users
    are breaking semantics to get desired look-and-feel.

    We now show tags in revision views.

    The parameters for Apache::SizeLimit are now set in the httpd.conf.
    These are read by Socialtext::Handler::Cleanup at startup time.
    No more hardcoded values in the .pm files.

    Includes in the Apache *.conf files now include "[^.#]*", instead of
    the more limiting "*.conf".

    In the "Save As" box for downloading attachments, we now suggest
    a filename.

    [FIXES]
    An old version of Text::Balanced was causing attachment indexing
    to slow down because of the use of the $& special variable.  We now
    require v1.99.0 of Text::Balanced that doesn't cause this problem.

    User was able to add a tag while editing a page, which would stay
    even if the page was canceled.

    Tag deletion used to increment the revision number.

    If you click on the "Your Watchlist" link on the dashboard, you are
    taken to the watchlist page, but the Watchlist tab is not highlighted.
    Now fixed.

    Show "1 view" instead of "1 views".

    Many other smaller fixes, and fixes in import-workspace and
    export-workspace.


    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Added .html to the Edit Tips refcard page.

    Added permissions note to the UPGRADE docs.  Thanks to Dobrica
    Pavlinusic for catching the error.


    [INTERNALS]
    All config files are now generated with Template Toolkit.

    Removed unused /st-archive handler from Socialtext Open.

    Added the --server-admin parameter to set the ServerAdmin parameter
    in the Apache config.

    Added the --support-address parameter to set the default support
    address if it's not set in /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf.

    Removed dependency on File::Copy::Recursive.

    Removed HTTP::BrowserDetect, replaced it with four lines of code in
    two functions in Socialtext::BrowserDetect.  Saves 889K bytes of
    memory usage in mod_perl.

    Socialtext::Workspace::Importer no longer gets loaded in Apache,
    since it's only used by the st-import-workspace utility.  Another 118K
    saved.

    All Perl and Javascript files now have copyright notices, plus
    a t/copyright.t test to make sure new ones don't get added
    without copyright.


    [DEVELOPMENT]
    Added an explicit --dev option to configure.  This is now available
    as get_build_setting('dev').

    Removed Apache::Reload as a prerequisite, unless you configure
    with --dev.

    dev-bin/list-module-deps now lets you pass --dev and --socialtext-open
    options, which will load DevDeps.yaml and omit EnterpriseDeps.yaml,
    respectively.

    Added a test file so that all .t files have shebang lines, strict
    and warnings.


2.0.0.1     Sat Nov  4 23:15:06 CST 2006

    Changes here are massive, since it includes all our Socialtext 2.0
    improvements.  They won't all be listed here.

    [FIXES]
    Removed a warning in the error log if apache-perl wasn't forwarded.

    [INTERNALS]
    Added t/case-conflict.t to watch for filenames that differ only
    in case.  This protects against conflicts on case-insensitive
    filesystems like HFS on Mac OS X.

    Updated all the Test::Socialtext-using programs to use the new
    fixture()-as-a-function method of specifying fixtures.

    Made the tests that use Test::MockObject skip_all if T::MO isn't
    installed.  We don't want to make another module install requirement
    for three tests.

--- Socialtext 1.x ---

1.10.7.4    Fri Sep 29 16:37:29 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    Fixed a potential problem with configure hanging.  Thanks, Luke Closs.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    The /etc/init.d/ scripts now work on Fedora Core.

    You can now specify the locate of your Apache module directories with
    --apache-perl-moduledir and --apache2-moduledir at ./configure time.
    This also removes the directory hunting from gen-config.

    Apache config no longer loads the mod_cgi module, since everything
    goes through mod_perl anyway.

    Removed more unused files that were only useful inside Socialtext
    the company.

    Removed all experimental code for FCGI and lighttpd.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Extensive docs on BSD now in docs/INSTALL.freebsd.  Thanks to
    Jason Crome.


1.10.7.1 Tue Sep 19 22:16:59 CDT 2006

This release incoroporates some bug fixing work done on the main line
of work inside Socialtext.  We're working towards some big new REST
API improvements.

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    Added st-admin --rename-workspace.

    Added --no-export flag for st-admin delete-workspace.

    Easier to understand sign-in/invitation emails

    [FIXES]
    The Apache status ExtendedStatus directive was in the wrong part of
    the apache-perl config file.

    Bug #19943: Deleted pages were showing up in searches.


1.10.5.1 Fri Sep 15 23:44:09 CDT 2006

This release works hard to improve portability and efficiency of memory
usage.  Not everyone has a couple of gigs to throw at their wiki server,
so we've been cleaning things up a bit.

The /etc/init.d scripts should now work whether you're running a
Debian-based distro, like Ubuntu, or a RedHat or SuSe distro.

A reminder: If you're using Socialtext Open on a public site, please add
it to https://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?socialtext_open_sites.
We'd love to see who's using Socialtext Open.


    [THINGS THAT MAY BREAK YOUR CODE]

    Removed the /etc/init.d/ceqlotron wrapper around /etc/init.d/st-apache
    and /etc/init.d/ceqlotron.  If you already have a Socialtext install,
    delete your /etc/init.d/socialtext, and instead use the st-apache
    and ceqlotron init scripts directly.


    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    /etc/init.d scripts should now run whether your system uses
    start-stop-daemon (Debian, Ubuntu), startproc (Red Hat, SuSe),
    or neither.

    Added /status and /perl-status URLs when configured with
    --apache-status.

    The user/group that ST runs on is now configurable with --st-user
    and --st-group flags to configure.

    No longer tries to load unused Apache modules: autoindex, status,
    db_auth.

    Removed unused handlers etc. from the Apache configurations.

    Socialtext::Ceqltron was getting loaded by Apache when it shouldn't
    have.

    Updated the invitation email to not be so likely to trip spam
    triggers.

    st-admin --help is now much easier to read.


    [FIXES]
    Installer is smarter and won't try to install vim backup files
    as scripts.

    Added "bc" package to the required package lists.

    Fixed some errors in the help documentation.

    Many other little bug fixes.


1.10.4.1    Wed Aug 30 15:25:13 CDT 2006

Socialtext Open is a major new release, with a new REST API available,
albeit in alpha stage.

This also allows you take advantage of the Socialtext Conversion Toolbox
(https://www.socialtext.net/stoss/index.cgi?socialtext_conversion_toolbox)
for converting from other wiki packages.

    [FIXES]
    Fixed dependency on Test::Base.

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    Removed dependencies on File::Find::Rule, Number::Compare and
    Text::Glob.

    Removed specific version dependency on Carp.

    [INTERNALS]
    Removed dependency on Socialtext::AppConfig in Socialtext::File.

    Removed dev-bin/deptree.  It is now included in the CPAN
    distribution Module::Depends::Tree.

    Values defined by configure are now contained/restricted to
    Socialtext::Build::ConfigureValues.

    All calls to GetOptions() die if any invalid options are passed.


1.10.0.5    Fri Aug 11 21:29:10 CDT 2006

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    If --hostname is specific when calling ./configure, it is now
    passed into /etc/socialtext/socialtext.conf as email_hostname and
    web_hostname.

    Removed the dependency on Plucene::Simple.  Plucene::Simple is now
    integrated into Socialtext::Search::Plucene::Simple.

    Removing Plucene::Simple also removed five dependent modules.


1.10.0.4    Wed Aug  9 22:15:37 CDT 2006

This is the first version we're not calling "beta".

    [IMPROVEMENTS]
    Removed 9 module dependencies, to help minimize install times.

    [FIXED]
    Fixed some tests that may have failed on some systems, depending on
    if you had Image::Magick or elinks installed.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Added documentation to INSTALL about the test user and test
    database that you need to have in Postgres.



1.10.0.3-beta   Fri Aug  4 16:00:40 CDT 2006

Configuration has changed slightly.  Now, if your HOSTNAME isn't fully
qualified, you can specify it before calling ./configure.  It used to
be you'd specify URL, but this is simpler, as in:

    HOSTNAME=mywiki.mysite.com ./configure

You only need to do this if your hostname is just the host's name, as in
"mywiki".

    [FIXES]
    Fixed a problem with redirections in the Apache configuration file.
    Also removed many extraneous mod_rewrite directives that aren't used
    for Socialtext Open.  Thanks, David Singer.

    The /var/run/socialtext directory is now created and given correct
    permissions on install.  Thanks, David Singer.

    Apache::SizeLimit is no longer required.

    Fixed a performance issue with Recent Changes.


1.10.0.2-beta   Thu Aug  3 15:00:19 CDT 2006

    [FIXES]
    Bug #1530704: Regex for URL doesn't allow dash in t/page-to-absolute.t

    [FEATURES]
    Updated to include features most recently in v1.10.1.1 on the
    hosted service.

    [DOCUMENTATION]
    Updates to the INSTALL file.


1.10.0.0-beta   Mon Jul 24 07:24:06 PDT 2006

    The first public beta of Socialtext Open.
